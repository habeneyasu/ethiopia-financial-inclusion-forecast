# Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis, model development, and visualization.

## Structure

- Analysis notebooks should be named descriptively (e.g., `01_data_exploration.ipynb`)
- Keep notebooks clean and well-documented
- Export final visualizations to `../reports/figures/`
